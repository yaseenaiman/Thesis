Wideband Channel Estimation for Hybrid Beamforming Millimeter Wave Communication Systems with Low-Resolution ADCs

- How to run:
* Load ‘top_simulation.m’ from Matlab, change parameters as you need and run.
* ‘top_simulation.m’ has system parameters to be used in simulation. It calls ‘top_sim_function.m’ function for actual simulation.
